The household is coed (previously split 3-3), LGBTQ friendly, 420 friendly, and we have two feline friends.
You'll be sharing a room with me. I'm a recent SFSU graduate and server/bartender at a local pizza place. When it comes to my personal and professional relationships, I hold myself to an Honesty Only policy, and it's what I value most in a person (especially someone I might be splitting a room with).
The kind of roommate I'm looking for is just someone who's a good fit. We've all have cringy roommate stories. My last roommate was and still is a good friend of mine, and I'm sad to see her go, but family duties call. So I'm not just trying to fill the spot, I'm hoping to find someone I'll be just as comfortable and enjoy living with.
Moving in is always nerve racking for both parties: for you, not knowing what kind of household you're stepping into; and for me, the anxiety over whether or not we'll get along. So I'd like to meet up with any potential roommate, get to know each other a bit, and introduce you to the rest of Pink House.
